# pinkStructure
UNITY Skeleton Project of the PYNKIES Math Game
---
I'm still a bit confused as to how object communicate with each other in a UNITY C# project; I have a project that I'm working on which has few components that I wish to keep, but the this was achieved by trial and error so a lot of cleanup is justified at this time.  I am wanting to gut out what I have and clean it up with a clear sense of direction, so his project is all about making a roadmap for the objects that I want to preserve and rehabilitate.
