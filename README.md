UNITY Skeleton Project of the PYNKIES Math Game
---
### Why does this Project Exist?

I have been developing a math game for children, and I've kludged my way though some early problems I had with UNITY (complete beginner type stuff: Triggers and Colliders, Physics and making Objects move etc. etc.)

I'm still a beginner, but I have some components I like and want to keep using.  I have other questions:

1) How Do Structure my Object so that those that need to communicate are able to do so?
   For example, my game manager needs to communicate with the ojects that trigger the "end of game" signal.  Sounds simple enough, but I'm just not clear on the details.
   
   There are also many other small communication issues that I want to resolve before I attempt to refactor/restructure what I have--in hopes that I won't end up with a totally irrepairable heap.  (I realize that the odds are very good that this is exactly where I'm heading, but I'm doing this seperate, testing project in order that I might answer some simple questions, before putting my actual project under the knife.
